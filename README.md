# About

Raccoon Music Player is a fun little music player. Made as a proof-of-concept Python app with the awesome [Dear PyGui](https://github.com/hoffstadt/DearPyGui/) and [PyMiniAudio](https://github.com/irmen/pyminiaudio) libraries, the project was created for the purpose of learning Python and gaining familiarity with the aforementioned libraries.

# Usage
Raccoon Music Player will list and play all MP3, WAV and FLAC music files that are stored in the music folder of the project. Copy your music files to the music folder, start the app and play your favourite tunes. ðŸ’•ðŸŽ¶

# Supported Operating Systems
Raccoon Music Player has been developed and tested on Windows 10. The libraries that are used for this app support Windows 10, Linux and MacOS. Therefore, the app should support all three platforms, but Linux and MacOS have not been tested.
