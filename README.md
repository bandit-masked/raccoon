# About

Raccoon Music Player (RMP) is a pocket-sized music player that shows raccoons dancing around a campfire while songs are playing. The app is a proof-of-concept, made with Python using on the excellent [Dear PyGui](https://github.com/hoffstadt/DearPyGui/) and [PyMiniAudio](https://github.com/irmen/pyminiaudio) libraries. The project was created for the purpose of learning Python and gaining familiarity with said libraries. As the focus was on learning and creating something fun while actually finishing the project, the feature set is deliberately restricted.

# Usage
Raccoon Music Player will list and play all MP3, WAV and FLAC music files that are stored in the music folder of the project. Copy your music files to the music folder, start the app and play your favourite tunes. ðŸ’•ðŸŽ¶

# Supported Operating Systems
Raccoon Music Player has been developed and tested on Windows 10. The libraries that are used for this app support Windows 10, Linux and MacOS. Therefore, the app should support all three platforms, but Linux and MacOS have not been tested. Dear PyGui currently does not support the Mac M1 platform, but it is expected that this will be supported as of Q1 2022.
