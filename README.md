# About

Raccoon Music Player is a pocket-sized music player that shows raccoons dancing around a campfire while songs are playing. It's a proof-of-concept app that was made with Python using the excellent [Dear PyGui](https://github.com/hoffstadt/DearPyGui/) and [PyMiniAudio](https://github.com/irmen/pyminiaudio) libraries. The project was created for the purpose of learning Python and gaining familiarity with these libraries. As the focus was on learning and creating something fun while actually finishing the project, the feature set is deliberately restricted.

The following videos demonstrate the use of Raccoon Music Player. Since the video player is muted by default, be sure to...
